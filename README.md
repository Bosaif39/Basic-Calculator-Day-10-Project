# **Basic Calculator**

## **Overview:**

This is the Day 10 project from the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp. This simple calculator program performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. Users can continue calculations using the result of the previous operation.

## **How It Works:**

1. **Function Definitions:**
   - **Addition (`add`)**: Returns the sum of two numbers.
   - **Subtraction (`sub`)**: Returns the difference between two numbers.
   - **Division (`div`)**: Returns the quotient of two numbers.
   - **Multiplication (`mult`)**: Returns the product of two numbers.

2. **User Interaction:**
   - The user is prompted to enter the first number.
   - They then choose an operation from the list of available operations (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication).
   - After selecting an operation, they input the second number, and the result is displayed.
   - The user can choose to continue calculations with the result or exit the program.

3. **Looping and Functionality:**
   - The program allows users to perform multiple calculations by using the result of the previous operation as the first number in the next calculation.
   - Users can exit the calculator by choosing not to continue.
